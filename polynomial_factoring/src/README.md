### Factoring polynomials

The ultimate goal of the project is to factoring a polynomial of degree $n$ completely in a finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$. It offers the following services:

- Find the inverse of an unit in Z_n
- Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two polynomials
- Test whether a polynomial is reducible in Z_p
- Factor the polynomial completely in Z_p
